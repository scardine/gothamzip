# Gotham Post

This repo is a "take home" excercise from a recruiter that asked to remain anonymous (so I can't post the requirements but it involves telling if a certain zipcode is valid according to some funny rules).

Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

I assume you will not deploy this toy project so just run it:

    python manage.py runserver
