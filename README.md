# Gotham Post

This repo is a "take home" excercise from a recruiter that asked to remain anonymous (so I can't post the requirements but it involves telling if a certain zipcode is valid according to some funny rules).

This was tested only in Python 2.7:

    $ python manage.py test
    Creating test database for alias 'default'...
    System check identified no issues (-1 silenced).
    ......
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 5 tests in 0.004s

    OK
    Destroying test database for alias 'default'...

Install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

I assume you will not deploy this toy project so just run it:

    python manage.py runserver
